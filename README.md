# Predicting Customer Churn in E-Commerce

This project aims to build a supervised machine learning model to predict customer churn in an e-commerce setting. Leveraging customer behavior and demographic data, the goal is to identify at-risk customers and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

## Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - E-commerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction)

The dataset includes customer-level data such as:
- Purchase frequency
- Demographics
- Customer engagement metrics
- Label indicating churn (Yes/No)

---

## Key Questions

- What customer behaviors are most predictive of churn?
- Can we segment users based on churn risk?
- How can the business proactively retain valuable customers?

---

## Toolkit

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and development
- **Streamlit** for a lightweight interactive app
- **GitHub** for version control and collaboration
